# Patryk Klimek - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio. This project was built from scratch to showcase my skills in modern web development, UI/UX design, and interactive animations.

## ## 🚀 Key Features

* **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with **Next.js 14** (App Router) and **TypeScript** for a robust, performant, and type-safe application.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive layout for all screen sizes, from mobile to ultra-wide desktops, using a custom **Tailwind CSS** configuration.

    * Staggered, on-scroll reveal animations for all sections.
    * A draggable "drag-to-scroll" timeline for work experience.
    * A "pop-out" image overlay for the portfolio section.
* **Custom UI Components:** All components, including buttons, cards, and modals, are custom-built.

* **Custom Design System:** Implements a unique design system in `tailwind.config.js` featuring:
    * Custom, responsive font scaling.
    * A reusable `glassmorphism` plugin.
    * A dynamic `neon` effect plugin that works with the site's color palette.
